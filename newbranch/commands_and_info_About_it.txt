git branch | used to see branches and the star tells which branch we are currently on 

git checkout | to change the branch 

git checkout -b new_branch | -b flag is used for creating new branch 

after changing the contents of file

we can push the new content to github then we have to make a pull request

pull request is used to review changes and see if it has some problems with the main branch contents

if there are no such problems . merge the two .

we can view the different branches on github too

git merge (for mereging code on local)

git diff (for watching chamges on local)

we can update our local main branch 

by using git pull origin main

git branch -d for deleting branch 


for existing files on branch if we modify it 

we can use git commit -am 

which means we are adding and commiting at the same time 

but this only works for pre existing files
