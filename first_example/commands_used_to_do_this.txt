git clone | cloned the repo 


git add .  |  added everything that was untracked 

we can also use "git add index.html" for above as it is only one file 

git commmit -m "first message" |  commited with a commit message

git push -u origin main | push file from git to github . the -u (upstream remote) flag links it to the remote repo 
also if we use -u  flag it will push changes to main beanch everytime as now main branch is setup as default branch for new push 

logged in with github credentails for first time via browser.

git status to see the status of files 
git push (after using -u flag)
